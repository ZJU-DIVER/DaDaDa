Target levels are set as follows.\nFirst, the annual target level is set at the company's most recent forecast for the current fiscal year.\nThe average progress rate over the past three years at the end of the relevant quarter is determined, and the annual target level multiplied by the average progress rate is set as the target level.\nHowever, if the company's forecast for the quarter exists, that value shall be used as the target level.

Market impact is rated on a 5-point scale. The timing of when the market impact is displayed is as follows\nWhen the market is open: The market impact is displayed approximately 10minutes after a material fact is identified.\nIf the market is closed: Around 9:25 a.m. on the next business day The score is not measured if it is not identified as a material fact.\nThe advantages of using the Material Fact Score is to select information to be viewed from among the vast amount of material facts (or timely disclosures related tomaterial facts) and to extract which material facts have impacted the market. On the other hand, the system is not real-time because it takes time to measure market impact and to identify material facts.
